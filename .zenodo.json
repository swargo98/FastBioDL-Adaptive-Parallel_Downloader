    "title": "FastBioDL: Adaptive Parallel Downloader for Large Genomic Datasets",
    "description": "Source code and evaluation scripts for FastBioDL, a parallel downloader that frames large-scale genomic data retrieval as an online optimisation problem. A gradient-descent controller dynamically tunes the number of concurrent HTTP/FTP streams, delivering up to 4× higher throughput on public SRA/ENA mirrors and up to 2.1× speed-ups on 20 Gbps testbeds compared with static-concurrency tools.",  // :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
